# current state

- Claude 4 Opus and Gemini Pro 2.5 can't even go down the first stairs, not in this scaffold or if I just chat via the UI with screenshots ("I'm just starting my first game of pokemon, an unreleased version for the GBA. Here's what I see so far. Don't give any hints or spoil the game for me, just recommend which actions to take to progress (like ["down", "up", "left", "right"] or other gameboy controls). What buttons should I press next?")
	- chat also failing gives me some reassurance that it's not just my ameteur prompting / this scaffold's failure to frame it as the user+assistant modality it's trained for
	- Opus even saw the stairs in the chat test and still didn't go for them
- o3 mostly worked in chat mode above! but takes several minutes per move
- Operator totally fails


# current issues

- claude keeps halucinating in the log and ignoring the screenshots
- giving screenshots to gemini and asking things like "what is the player facing?" it says wrong things (https://gemini.google.com/u/0/app/34453716d633d996)
	- claude gets it though


# misc ideas

- main loop could be:
	- scratchpad + last N moves + system prompt + "did what just happened materially affect what I should have written in my scratchpad?"
		- if yes, rewrite scratchpad
	- scratchpad + last N moves (+deletion warning) + system prompt + 'output one-line summary of situation, next move (options [...])'
	- ^repeat
	- maybe it's allowed to have a CoT before outputting the output
- system prompt ideas
	- this is a log and scratchpad of someone meticulously documenting their pokemon playthrough. it's their first time but they're very smart
	- you are a state of the art AI, here is your scratchpad and recent moves, or something like that


when the log gets too long
"(N log messages hidden. The next two lines will be deleted shortly)"


Maybe one of the actions is just "update scratchpad" and that prompts that flow, and it can just do it whenever as a normal action.
And there's an example of it being used sparingly in the initial logs 


claude notes
- starting to think I should interleave 'user' and 'assistant' messages, where the screenshots are user and summaries + moves are assistant
    - I don't think gemini can do this though so maybe not


computer use demo looks pretty similar to what I have tbh: https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts/tree/main/computer-use-demo
(and also doesn't seem to work great)


idea: put at the top: "steps to first badge: [low N]" etc so it thinks it's a good playthrough


removed all the notes to self because they just hallucinate and go off the rails. maybe need to add it back later but they're not long range enough yet


new stuff to try:
- maybe no action log? but then it might not be able to tell what's impassible
- add openai api, worth testing if my scaffold works with o3 via API or if there's something special about chat. also test o4-mini etc
- be more explicit about stuff like "first understand the scene and then decide a medium term plan and then give me the actions you want to take
- go deeper on other scaffolds to see if a better prompt could unlock more (already skimmed these but they really emphasized tool use so I thought there wasn't much to copy after the first pass)
