# current issues

claude keeps halucinating in the log and ignoring the screenshots


# misc ideas

- main loop could be:
	- scratchpad + last N moves + system prompt + "did what just happened materially affect what I should have written in my scratchpad?"
		- if yes, rewrite scratchpad
	- scratchpad + last N moves (+deletion warning) + system prompt + 'output one-line summary of situation, next move (options [...])'
	- ^repeat
	- maybe it's allowed to have a CoT before outputting the output
- system prompt ideas
	- this is a log and scratchpad of someone meticulously documenting their pokemon playthrough. it's their first time but they're very smart
	- you are a state of the art AI, here is your scratchpad and recent moves, or something like that



when the log gets too long
"(N log messages hidden. The next two lines will be deleted shortly)"



Maybe one of the actions is just "update scratchpad" and that prompts that flow, and it can just do it whenever as a normal action.
And there's an example of it being used sparingly in the initial logs 



claude notes
- starting to think I should interleave 'user' and 'assistant' messages, where the screenshots are user and summaries + moves are assistant
    - I don't think gemini can do this though so maybe not
