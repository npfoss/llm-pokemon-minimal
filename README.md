# minimal pokemon scaffold for LLMs

the others have way too many training wheels. How do the LLMs do in the cold hard real world?

# setup

install python 3.12

probably get in your python venv, for me that's
```bash
python3 -m venv venv # first time, to create
source venv/bin/activate # every time, to enter the venv
```

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

# run

python3 main.py
